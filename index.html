        About me
        <h3 class="section__organizer">Origin</h3>
        <h2 class="section__description">
          I was born in Chernivitsi, Ukraine (fun fact, Mila Kunis was also born there). When I was 5 years old my family and I moved to the US and we
          have been living in Washington state ever since. (Isn't it neat how the Python logo has the same color scheme as the Ukrainian flag!)

        <h3 class="section__organizer">Education</h3>
        <h2 class="section__description">
          I am a first generation college graduate and have recently completed my degree in Computer Science at Washington State University. I pursued
          CS because I've always enjoyed making, breaking, and fixing things, and have been captivated by computers and technology since childhood.
          Through my four year experience at college, I have had my eyes opened to a whole new world of innovation and creativity. Although I've
          graduated now, I haven't stopped learning. I have recently taken a Python class and a JavaScript class on Udemy. The JavaScript class in
          particular, has come in handy for building this portfolio website. <br />

        <h3 class="section__organizer">Hobbies</h3>
        <h2 class="section__description">
          High school and college introduced me to a whole slew of hobbies that I currently enjoy to this day. <br />
          <br />Chess: In high school I was president of the Chess club and would spend most of my lunch breaks beating my teachers. <br />
          <br />Volleyball: At Clark college, I took a volleyball class and played volleyball for the first time ever in my life. I immediately fell
          in love with the sport and have now been playing for about 7 years. Clark college volleyball intramurals was also where I met my lovely wife
          Emma, who is also a very strong volleyball player. Since starting the sport, I have participated in and won a few men's doubles and also
          reverse-coed doubles tournaments alongside my wife in the Vancouver/Portland area. <br />
          <br />Table Tennis: Washington State University was where I was introduced to Table Tennis and eventually ended up forming the WSU Table
          Tennis Club with a few friends. As a club we held a few recreational tournaments and I thoroughly enjoyed playing in them and winning a few.
