Portfolio website for myself.
This website is hosted using a domainname created from AWS Route 53.
The website contents are hosted on AWS S3 using 2 buckets.
Then finally the website is live on the web using Amazon CloudFront for a more secure browsing experience and faster content delivery due to CloudFront's caching features/ edge locations.
